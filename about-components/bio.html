            <h1>Introducing The Author</h1>

            <p>
              American novelist and short story writer Stephen King was born in
              Portland, Maine, on September 21, 1947. His works are recognized
              for having revived the genre of horror fiction in the latter half
              of the 20th century. Stephen King resides in Maine and Florida
              with his wife, Tabitha King, who is also a prominent author1.
              They've been married since January 1971 and have three children:
              Naomi, Joe, and Owen1. Both Joe and Owen followed in their
              parents' footsteps and became authors themselves1. Despite his
              popularity, Stephen King had financial difficulties in his early
              life. Stephen's mother, Nellie, supported him and his older
              brother, David2, by working various low-paying jobs after his
              father abandoned the family when he was just two years old. These
              early experiences of struggle and tenacity impacted his narrative,
              adding depth and reality to his characters.

            <!--Second Part-->
            <h1>The begining of his career</h1>
            <p>
              Stephen King sold his first professional short story, "The Glass
              Floor", to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967.[1] After graduating
              from the University of Maine, King earned a certificate to teach
              high school but was unable to find a teaching post immediately. He
              sold short stories to magazines like Cavalier. Many of these early
              stories were republished in Night Shift (1978). In 1971, King was
              hired as an English teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden,
              Maine.[1] He continued to contribute short stories to magazines
              and worked on ideas for novels, including the anti-war novel Sword
              in the Darkness, still unpublished.[23

          <!--Third Part-->
          <h1>Stephen King Aesthetic</h1>
          <p>
            Stephen King’s writing style is known for its vivid character
            development and exploration of fear, often drawing readers into dark
            psychological realms. His works frequently delve into human
            vulnerability, moral struggles, and societal flaws, with
            supernatural elements used to intensify psychological tension.
            Influenced by authors like H.P. Lovecraft and Richard Matheson, King
            also incorporates themes of isolation, trauma, and family dynamics,
            particularly in the context of small-town life. His stories resonate
            widely due to their grounded exploration of both the ordinary and
            the supernatural. King’s themes often include the impact of
            childhood experiences, the complexities of good versus evil, and the
            redemptive potential of individuals facing extraordinary
            circumstances. His portrayal of horror is multifaceted, weaving in
            suspense, thriller, and even a touch of humor. This blend of genres
            and his unique character focus have made him a leading figure in
            contemporary horror literature, with his novels shedding light on
            the dark, often unsettling facets of human nature.
