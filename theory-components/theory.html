          begin by discussing the design process of my exam project,
          highlighting the new strategies I employed to create user-friendly
          UI/UX designs. This includes an examination of the interactivity
          features I implemented and the narrative elements that support the
          project’s overall theme. Next, I will address the challenges I
          encountered during the development phase. I will detail how I
          navigated these obstacles and transformed them into learning
          opportunities, ultimately strengthening my design objectives. Finally,
          I will reflect on my personal growth throughout this project. I will
          consider how the skills and insights I’ve gained will support my
          future career as a web designer and align with professional practices
          in the industry. With that in mind, let us dive into this critical
          reflection essay.

          The Global Economic and Artistic Implications of Web Technologies
        </h2>

        <!--Paragraph 1 -->
        <p class="text">
          The Cambridge Dictionary defines the global economy as “the way in
          which economies have been developing to operate together as one
          system” (Cambridge Dictionary). Understanding this concept is crucial
          for knowing how it connects to website development. By exploring
          multiple definitions, I found that the Cambridge Dictionary’s
          explanation stood out the most with me. It highlights that the global
          economy refers to the connection that occurs between multiple
          countries who work within economic activities that will create a
          crucial positive benefit on the countries involved. Through this
          definition I had to find out how the global economy is connected with
          the website development, which becomes clear when we consider the
          economic advantages that websites can bring. These include market
          expansion, which looks at how businesses needs to ubiquity skills to
          enable them to connect with audiences internationally without having
          to physically travel. Through this process, business are able to reach
          target audiences and sales through websites. The second advantage
          includes the growth of e-commerce, which looks at aspects of online
          communication and online platforms. This has become the most efficient
          new way of being able to connect with clients, offering them services
          and product online. This has boosted global trade and economic
          activity as it offers immersive diverse opportunities and job creation
          in the industry of website development. Lasty the job creation, the
          new digital space made things easy and efficient in the creative
          industry. There is a high demand in the world of digital marketing,
          new digital skills and techniques are always brought up contributing
          to creating new job opportunities and economic growth.

        <h2 class="headings">How Global Economy Impacts Artistic Design</h2>

        <!--Paragraph 2 -->
        <p class="text">
          Global economy has made an impact in arts and design in spaces of
          website development. As a website designer it is crucial to
          understand, acknowledge and research the art style and design
          techniques you are going to employ in the project. Website designers
          needs to look beyond beauty and arts and understand culture of the
          economy they are working with, respecting and understanding the
          diversity by looking at the factors of being able to employ cultural
          aesthetics, themes and content that resonate with diverse clients or
          company. There should be a background story through each
          implementation of design, understand colors used, pictures, friendly
          UI/UX design and user experience. Beyond this, website designers needs
          to understand the type of content they are going to provide or what
          the client has requested, since this includes global interconnection,
          it is important to understand the language and cultural content.
          Understanding this content, made me look broader at the implications
          that I have fundamentally used in my design project, how I have
          incorporated design techniques that carry cultural content, narrative
          story, the client and his preferred aesthetics and also how I have to
          develop and smooth functional user engagement that will enhance my
          project usability and development.

        <h2 class="headings">The Design Techniques I Have Used.</h2>

        <!--Paragraph 3 -->
        <p class="text">
          Through understanding these techniques, I have implemented the design
          techniques that aligned with the author I am presenting on my website
          named Stephen King. Stephen King is a best seller award winning author
          who was born in Portland, Maine, in 1947. He is mostly known for
          publishing books and novels that resonate with the following genres,
          horror, suspense and fantasy. I had to consider his cultural and
          aesthetic style that he usually resonate with, through look at the
          horror genre, I had to choose the color scheme wisely and see his
          other previous website that he has. Mosty of his work combine and
          dwell on dark colors, however I had to will modify them, to make
          interactivity easier and creating friendly user engagement through
          complying 60-30-10 rule. Stephen King works lean and evoke around dark
          colors which evoke emotions of dark and suspenseful atmospheres as he
          mostly writes horror books. His colors are leaning towards darker,
          moody colors like deep blacks, grays, and muted tones. However, the
          colors that I picked where the following: White smoke, charcoal blue
          and smoke red.

        <h2 class="headings">UI/UX Designs</h2>

        <!--Paragraph 4 -->
        <p class="text">
          I had to reflect on my previous website design and analyze the
          feedback I received. By reviewing this feedback, I refined my project
          by changing the user experience design and implementing a new approach
          that aligns with the client’s aesthetic, as their work mostly focuses
          on horror, suspense, and fantasy. I conducted brief research to
          understand how authors’ websites are typically structured and to
          determine how I could make my design both neat and efficient. I had to
          provide several pages that will include the content behind my website
          and academic requirements I need to implement on my website. To
          enhance user-friendly engagement, I highlighted important buttons with
          an attractive, soft red color, using it sparingly (about 10% of the
          website) to draw attention to key content. Additionally, since the
          website contains several pages, I implemented a dropdown menu to
          organize them neatly, ensuring readability without overwhelming the
          website or its users. Lastly, I incorporated animation styles that
          seamlessly blend with the website’s theme and enhance its
          interactivity.

        <h2 class="headings">Data Visualization</h2>

        <!--Paragraph 5 -->
        <p class="text">
          With data visualization, I had to reflect on the mistakes I previously
          made and deepen my understanding of what effective data visualization
          entails. This includes exploring how users interact with visual data,
          especially when it’s interactive, and how it presents a narrative to
          help users understand the content of the data that has been displayed.
          For this project, I used a complex API focused on Stephen King’s
          books. This API provided extensive data, including information about
          his works, achievements such as nominations and awards, the number of
          pages per book, publication years, and even the villains featured in
          each story. My challenge was to decide which data to present in my
          interactive visualization and how I want to provide a better
          understanding analysis and communication of information I will
          display. I opted to create graphical representations of the data using
          bar graphs and pie charts. For instance, I used a bar graph to plot
          the publication years on the x-axis and compare the number of pages
          for each book on y-axis. This approach this approach, I have created
          meaning successfully. Additionally, I reconsidered my design
          techniques, particularly the color scheme. I replaced the previous
          colors with a palette that better aligns with both the author’s dark
          and suspenseful aesthetic and the overall theme of my website. To
          enhance user engagement, I included interactive buttons that allow
          users to toggle certain data points on or off, providing them with a
          more customizable experience.

          The Role of Interactivity in Your Project and Its Impact on User
          Experience and Data Interpretation
        </h2>

        <!--Paragraph 6 -->
        <p class="text">
          The role of interactivity in this project was to provide users with an
          engaging and user-friendly experience while exploring my website.
          Interactivity is present on every page, starting with the navigation
          bar and dropdown menus, which allow users to seamlessly explore
          different sections and their respective content. The navigation bar
          offers an immersive experience, enabling users to switch between pages
          from one page to another. This allows users to engage with the whole
          website effectively and friendly. I also incorporated various
          interactive elements, such as buttons, each designed to produce a
          specific outcome. For instance, the "Read More" button on the About
          page allows users to delve deeper into the author’s biography, sourced
          from Wikipedia. This feature gives users an opportunity to learn more
          about the author, including his career, achievements, and personal
          milestones. Additionally, users can explore related images via a
          bottom-scroller bar. To further enhance the user experience, I
          provided a link to the full Wikipedia page, enabling users to dive
          deeper into the author’s life and works. Other interesting interactive
          features include social media icons in the footer, which direct users
          to Stephen King’s personal websites and fan pages, keeping them
          updated with his latest news and activities. These interactive
          techniques significantly improve the user experience, making the
          website more engaging, accessible, and informative.

          The Most Pressing Challenges Faced During Development and How They
          Were Tackled
        </h2>

        <!--Paragraph 7 -->
        <p class="text">
          Throughout the design process, I faced several challenges that
          ultimately helped me grow, think critically, and refine my skills as a
          website developer. Each obstacle pushed me to find creative solutions
          and improve my design approach. The first major challenge was
          determining the right UI/UX design to implement. I was working with a
          client who is an author specializing in horror, suspense, and fantasy
          novels. His aesthetic needed to be reflected on the website, and I
          also had to consider his demographic as an adult male. Choosing the
          appropriate design, art style, and other techniques was difficult
          because I wanted all elements to harmonize and align with the
          project’s theme. To overcome this, I critically analyzed the feedback
          from my lecturers and used it to develop a more engaging and visually
          appealing design. I conducted research on how website are structured,
          the type of content they provide and how users engage with it. This
          research informed the redesign of my wireframes and style guide.
          Another significant challenge was selecting a color scheme that
          accurately represented the author’s brand. I explored his book covers,
          original website, and various online discourses about his style,
          taste, themes, and aesthetics. I identified the colors he frequently
          uses in his work and incorporated them into my design to ensure
          consistency and relevance. These challenges helped me gain a deeper
          understanding of the web development process, think like a designer,
          and develop problem-solving strategies. Each challenge strengthened my
          ability to create meaningful and effective design solutions.

        <h2 class="headings">
          How Your Project Aligns with Professional Practices in International
          Web/App Development
        </h2>

        <!--Paragraph 8 -->
        <p class="text">
          That’s an interesting question. I’m not entirely sure if I can answer
          it definitively, as I only began my journey as a web developer a few
          months ago, and this is the second website I’ve created. However, I’ve
          learned a great deal throughout this experience. I’ve realized that
          web development is not just about coding and designing, it’s about
          thinking like a critical designer. It involves understanding why you
          choose specific design elements, the meaning behind colors, and how to
          effectively solve challenges. One of the most important lessons I’ve
          learned is the value of designing with the user in mind. It’s
          essential to test your website by inviting others to engage with it
          and gather feedback on its interactivity and user-friendliness. This
          practice mirrors the iterative testing process used in professional
          web and app development. Although I’m still at the beginning of my
          journey, I believe the skills I’ve acquired during this project I have
          gained the following skills: critical thinking, user-centered design,
          and problem-solving are foundational in international web development.
          These skills will be invaluable as I take on larger projects with the
          potential to reach global audiences. This project also became the
          first long professional work that I have produced throughout my
          learning experience, I believe it will part of my portfolio, and I
          will reflect back to it as I grow stronger in the field of website
          development
