                The Man in Black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger
                followed. So begins Book I of Stephen King’s iconic fantasy
                series, The Dark Tower. Part sci-fi novel, part futuristic
                dystopia, part spaghetti Western, and part high fantasy vision,
                The Gunslinger tells the story of Roland Deschain, Mid-World’s
                last gunslinger, who is tracking an enigmatic magician known
                only as the man in black. Following his quarry across the
                demon-infested Mohaine Desert, Roland confronts a mad preacher
                woman and her murderous flock, holds palaver with a speaking
                demon, and finally befriends a young boy from our world named
                Jake Chambers. Jake joins Roland on his quest, but while Roland
                travels with his young companion Jake, the man in black travels
                with Roland’s soul in his pocket. The 2003 revised edition of
                The Gunslinger contains the essay "On Being Nineteen (And a few
                other things)" by Stephen.

                After his final confrontation with the Man in Black in a remote
                mountain Golgotha, an exhausted Roland awakes on the beach of
                the Western Sea and is immediately attacked by a shoreline
                monster known as a lobstrosity. Roland kills the clawed
                creature, but not before it bites off two of his fingers and
                half of one big toe. Fighting off the delirium brought on by the
                lobstrosity’s poison, Roland forces himself along the beach
                where he discovers three freestanding doorways that lead into
                our world. The first opens onto New York, 1987, and the mind of
                a heroin addict called Eddie Dean. The second leads to 1964 and
                the divided personality of Odetta Holmes/Detta Walker, an
                African American woman who has lost the bottom half of her legs
                but gained a second, psychotic self. The third door leads to
                1977 and the mind of a psychopath called The Pusher, the very
                criminal responsible for Odetta’s injuries. Roland’s task is to
                make Eddie and Odetta into gunslingers before raging Detta
                destroys them all, and before the Pusher can continue his bloody
                killing spree.

                Several months have passed, and Roland’s two new tet-mates have
                become proficient gunslingers. Eddie Dean has given up heroin,
                and Odetta’s two selves have joined, becoming the stronger and
                more balanced personality of Susannah Dean. But while battling
                The Pusher in 1977 New York, Roland altered ka by saving the
                life of Jake Chambers, a boy who—in Roland’s where and when—has
                already died. Now Roland and Jake exist in different worlds, but
                they are joined by the same madness: the paradox of double
                memories. Roland, Susannah, and Eddie must draw Jake into
                Mid-World then follow the Path of the Beam all the way to the
                Dark Tower. But nothing is easy in Mid-World. Along the way our
                tet stumbles into the ruined city of Lud, and are caught between
                the warring gangs of the Pubes and the Grays. The only way out
                of Lud is to wake Blaine the Mono, an insane train that has a
                passion for riddling, and for suicidal journeys.
